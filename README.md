API is Application Programming Interface, that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It enables developers to access specific features or data from a service without needing to understand its complex internal operations.

For example chatgpt is a service from OpenAI. If you want to use chatgpt like features in your own application, you will need to use API from OpenAI. Service providers sell their API subsciptions. OpenAI API will cost you depending on how much you use it. 

This video is exciting because we have a way to get the API from an AI that will not cost anything. We can use AI for free in our own application. 

Imagine if you are a wordpress developer or react js developer, you can integrate AI in your own website without paying anything. You can integrate AI in your clients websites. All you have to do is to get a free API key from a provider.

Now i can get the key from deepseek platform also, but that will cost me. So I will use a free API provider that allows us to use AI API for free. So let's make our own AI Chatbot with Deepseek API (100% Free!).
