"API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a bridge that lets developers access specific features or data from a service without needing to understand all its internal workings.

For example, ChatGPT is a service from OpenAI. If I want to use ChatGPT-like features in my own app or website, I’ll need to use their API—which usually comes with a cost depending on how much I use it.

But here’s the exciting part: in this video, I’ll show you how to get access to an AI API completely for free! Yes, you can use AI in your own application without paying anything.

If you're a WordPress developer or ReactJS developer, this is a game-changer. You can now integrate AI into your own or your client’s websites—at zero cost. All you need is a free API key from a provider.

While Gemini API is one of the available options, it usually comes with usage limits or charges. That’s why I’ll show you how to use a free API provider to create your own AI chatbot with Gemini API—100% free!"
